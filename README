BUILD, CHECK and INSTALL
------------------------

Normally the correct makefile_xxxxx will be picked automatically just typing: 

  make

to discover the current platform and make for Linux, MacOSX, FreeBSD, OpenBSD,
NetBSD, Solaris/SunOS and Win32 (MinGW on MSYS). Sometimes the makefile_xxxxx
must be specified explicitely, e.g. when compiling for the RaspberryPi runnning
a sub-flavor of Linux and cross-compiled on a desktop system:

  make -f makefile_raspberrypi

Any other makefile_xxxxx can be picked the same way, but always read the
makefile_xxxxx first, sometimes it contains special instructions!

To test the compiled newlisp executable do:

  make check

or showing only success or failure:

  make testall

From a user account if the sudo command and admin password is available:

  sudo make install

If root permissions are not available:

  make install_home

home_install does not install the newLISP-GS Java based IDE, but installs
the supportig documentation.

see all flavors and platforms available for install:

  make help

will list all available platforms and flavors, newLISP can also be made as
a shared, dhynamic library: newlisp.so, newlisp.dylib or  newlisp.dll

To discover the platform in an extra step do:

  ./configure

  make

this discovers the platform and generates a makefile_build which
is used subsequently by make. As an alternative use:

  ./configure-alt

  make

this does a more elaborate analysys of options supported on a specific
platform and custom makes a makefile_build.

See the files doc/INSTALL, doc/LOCALIZATION and doc/FILES for more
detailed information.

MINIMUM INSTALL
---------------
Note that for a minumum install only the executable newlisp or newlisp.exe
in Win32 is necessary.

On Mac OS X or other UNIX copy  newlisp to /usr/local/bin or /usr/bin or ~/bin 
and give it executable permissions.
