.SH DESCRIPTION
newlispdoc is a commandline utility written in newLISP to generate HTML documentation from comments written in newLISP source files. Consult /usr/share/doc/newlisp/newLISPdoc.html for a detailed description on how to write comments usable for newlispdoc. The newlispdoc command should be executed from inside the directory where the newLISP source files can be found. The generated documetation files will have .html added to the name of the source file. An index.html page is generated, which is listing for each file links to all the documented functions.
