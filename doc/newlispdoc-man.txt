NAME
       newlispdoc - generate documentation from newLISP source comments

SYNOPSIS
       newlispdoc [-s] [-d] lisp-file1 [lisp-file2 ...]

       newlispdoc [-s] [-d] [-url] urls-file

DESCRIPTION
       newlispdoc is a commandline utility written in newLISP to generate HTML
       documentation from comments written in newLISP  source  files.  Consult
       /usr/share/doc/newlisp/newLISPdoc.html  for  a  detailed description on
       how to write comments usable for  newlispdoc.  The  newlispdoc  command
       should  be  executed from inside the directory where the newLISP source
       files can be found. The generated documetation files  will  have  .html
       added  to the name of the source file. An index.html page is generated,
       which is listing for each file links to all the  documented  functions.
       If  the  current directory contains the file newlispdoc.css, it will be
       used for formatting HTML output. For a sample  see  util/newlispdoc.css
       in the source distribution.

OPTIONS
       -s     this  option  causes  newlispdoc to also generate a syntax high-
              lighted HTML file of the source. A link to  this  file  will  be
              present  in  the  HTML documentation of this file. The generated
              file will have the added extension .src.html.

       -d     also generate a link to the raw unformatted sourcefile.

       lisp-file
              is a commented newLISP source file from  which  a  documentation
              file will be generated.

       -url   this  option  is used to retrieve newLISP source files for docu-
              mentation from remote locations.

       urls-file
              is a file containing urls of newLISP source files, one  url  per
              line.

EXAMPLES
       Generate all documentation form files in the current directory.
              newlispdoc afile.lsp bfile.lsp


       Generate  documentation  and  syntax highlighted HTML versions from all

       Retrieve  source  files  for  documentation from remote locations. Each
       file is specified on one line in urls.txt with its http:// address.
