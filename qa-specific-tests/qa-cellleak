If this test reports cell leaks, but also shows errors during 
the execution of the qa-dot script then run again. If qa-dot runs
fine on its own but shows error during repeated execution in this 
script, it is because of syncronization errors when freeing 
file resources. This seems to ccur only on Windows. In this case 
try running again or test on a less busy, faster system.
